Fresh build was done on 19/04/16. This built Release and Debug targetting x86 and compiled in both STATIC and DYNAMIC.

To build: Download ENET source, extract and place premake5.exe inside directory. Add IDE platform to command line then open
solution file. Add both libraries:
	
#pragma comment(lib, "Ws2_32.lib")

	#pragma comment(lib, "WINMM.LIB")

... into enet.h.

Change project "code generation" to the appropriate versions without the "DLL" attached (for static .lib linking)
